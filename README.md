# ARKit-Education
A simple way of implementing ARKit for H-12 students to watch video of how dianosors extinced!

In this implementation, I used a simple picture of a fossil, and by hovering the camera on that image, 
the app detects it and starts showing an educational video about how dinosaurs extinct.
